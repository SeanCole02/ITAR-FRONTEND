# ITAR-FRONTEND

ITAR-FRONTEND is the frontend of the web-based scanning tool ITAR that helps users identify malicious .jar files . This README file serves as a guide for contributors to adhere to the design philosophy of ITAR and create a user-friendly experience for visitors.

ITAR uses Python-Flask for its frontend.

## Design Philosophy

The following UI design philosophy for ITAR must be followed when making changes or submitting pull requests:

### Clean and Modern Layout

ITAR's website should have a modern, clean layout that is easy on the eyes and enhances the user's experience. The use of white space will ensure that the interface is not cluttered and that the user can focus on the scanning tool. The site's color palette should be simple and consistent, with the use of bright colors to highlight important features.

### Intuitive Navigation

ITAR's website should have an intuitive navigation system that guides the user to the scanning tool. The navigation menu should be clearly labeled and located in a prominent position on the website.

### Prominent Call to Action

The scanning tool must be the primary focus of the website, and a prominent call to action should be placed above the fold. The call to action should be clear, concise, and encourage users to upload files for scanning.

### User-Friendly

The scanning tool should be user-friendly, with a simple and easy-to-use interface. Users should be able to upload files with just a few clicks and should be intuitive to users of all backgrounds. The tool must also include a progress bar, so users can track the progress of the scan.

### Results Page

The results page should be easy to read and understand, with a simple layout that presents the results clearly. Users should be able to view the detailed results of the scan.

### Advertiser Banners

The website must have sufficient white space to accommodate advertiser banners without compromising the user's experience. Advertiser banners should be placed in areas that do not interfere with the scanning tool or the results page.
